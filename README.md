# Body-Mass-Index
This is a weight class calculating the BMI (Body Mass Index) based on height and weight by the user's input.

# What I've learned
- Similar calculation from my weight BMI calculator in C++. The variables are included in the class method.

```java
    double weightPounds = input.nextInt();
		double heightMeters = heightInches * 2.54/100;
		double weightKilos = weightPounds * 453.59/1000;
		double bmi = weightKilos/(heightMeters * heightMeters);
```

# Here is an example
